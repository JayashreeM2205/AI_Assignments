Overall Score: 64 / 100

Improvement Areas:

* Add explicit acceptance criteria for the bank selection process, such as the expected behavior when a user searches for a bank or selects an option from the dropdown menu.
* Specify preconditions, such as the user's role and access to the system, to ensure that the user story is well-defined and testable.
* Clarify the connection to tangible healthcare value, such as patient safety or operational efficiency, to ensure that the user story aligns with the project's goals and objectives.
* Provide more specific details about the bank selection process, such as the expected input and output, to facilitate testing and implementation.
* Consider adding non-functional requirements, such as performance or security constraints, to ensure that the user story is well-rounded and feasible to implement.
